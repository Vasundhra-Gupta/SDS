# 🌟 EduSupport – Breaking Financial Barriers to Empower Students

## 💡 Overview
**EduSupport** is a comprehensive AI-driven platform designed to help economically weaker students overcome financial barriers to education. The platform connects *needy students* with *donors*, offers *scholarship and loan guidance*, enables *secure fund distribution*, and integrates *emotional & career support* to minimize dropouts and maximize student success.

**EduSupport follows a modern 3-tier architecture. The frontend, built in React with Vite, interacts with an Express.js backend. The server handles business logic, authentication, academic data processing, and AI interactions using the Gemini API. All data is stored securely in a MongoDB database. Donations are processed via GPay or UPI, ensuring secure transactions.**

## 🔧 How It Works (Workflow Summary)
1. **Students Apply** – Needy students register, verify Aadhaar, and submit financial, educational, and bank details.
2. **AI-Based Categorization** – Students are categorized into `High`, `Medium`, or `Low` need based on multiple criteria using AI.
3. **Donors Contribute** – Donations can be:
   - **Personal** – Donors select verified student profiles.
   - **Platform-Based** – Funds are distributed automatically by the platform based on need percentage.
4. **Fund Distribution Strategy**
   - 40% ➝ High-Need Students
   - 30% ➝ Medium-Need Students
   - 25% ➝ Low-Need Students
   - 5% ➝ Platform Sustainability (website economy & student support services)
5. **Access to Resources** – Students receive study materials, college/school resources, and peer-shared content.
6. **Dropout Prevention** – Integrated with **Gemini API** for personalized AI-guided dropout support.
7. **Scholarship & Loan Finder** – Smart suggestions based on branch, income, and academic details.
8. **Secure Payments** – Seamless donation and disbursement via **Google Pay API**.
9. **Counseling & Webinars** – Admin-approved counselors provide 1-on-1 sessions or webinars for mental, academic, and career support.
